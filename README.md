React Food Recipe Website

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
The application is fairly straightforward to use. Simply enter a search term in the search bar and press enter or click the search button. The application will then fetch recipe data from the API and display it in a list. You can click on a recipe to view more details.
